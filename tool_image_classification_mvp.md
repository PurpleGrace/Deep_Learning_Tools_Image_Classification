# Deep Learning project
## Initial for a platform of mechanical tools sharing  -- Tools Image Classification
The goal of the project is to classify mechanical tools with image downloaded from kaggle.

My first model is convolutional neural network(CNN) with an accuracy of .516.The plot blow shows the change of accuracy score along with training epochs.
